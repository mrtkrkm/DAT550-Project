       "<span style=\"color: blue\"> Covid-19 has spread globly within 60 days with focus areas in asia, europe and the middle east. Human-to-human transmission is occurring and there are increasing confirmed cases around multiple countries every day. The virus shares up to 80% of the gene sequence with other members of coronavirus family. A series of pneumonia cases caby a novel coronavirus, 33 namely 2019-ncov, emerged in wuhan, the capitcity of hubei province in china. The symptoms of covid-19 range from mild to severe. They can be 93 fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, and in some severe cases, kidney failure or death may occur. The virus can be transmitted from human to human. Covid-19 can be found in human respiratory epithelicells after about 96 hours, while it takes about 6 days to isolate and culture vero e6 and huh-7 cell lines. 5 human-to-human transmission has been confirmed for the virus, 6,7 which is related to acute respiratory syndrome and middle eastern respiratory syndrome. The first person in the united states with diagnosed 2019-ncov infection was reported. Covid-19 has spread to more than three dozen countries with over 80,000 confirmed cases by late february. in a low-to-middle-income country could lead to massive numbers of patients with acute respiratory disease and death. in china, policies include unprecedented lockdowns to reduce contacts bween individus. A novel coronavirus (sars-cov-2) that emerged out of the city of wuhan, china in december 2019 has ready demonstrated its potentito generate explosive outbreaks in confined stings and cross borders following human mobility patterns. The main route of human-to-human transmission of 2019-ncov is probably through respiratory dropls. respiratory support is the most important means of life support. Sars-cov-2 may be less deadly than the influenza virus that hospits dewith on an annubasis, and transmission seems to occur mainly through dropls. We do not know what, if any, long-term effects this virus might have on the human body. The main source of infection comes from covid-19 pneumonia patients currently. The coronavirus is highly contagious and highly contagious. The virus has an incubation period of 2-14 days before symptoms appear. There are 85,403 cases worldwide, of which 79,394 correspond to china. 53 countries, including spain, have reported at least one case. The emergence of a novel coronavirus, 2019-ncov in wuhan december 2019 has led to a globresponse to the first epidemic of this decade. It has highlighted two key issues : first, china ' s rapid and efficient capacity to identify and investigate a newly emerging disease. and second, our continued globvulnerability to epidemics and pandemics. A cluster of pneumonia caby a novel coronavirus, covid-19, was first reported in wuhan in the hubei province in china in late december 2019. since then, severthousand cases have been reported in mainland china, with spread to over two dozen countries. we strongly believe that the virus is likely to be 190 spreading through the air. we present the only case with sars-cov-2 infection during pregnancy in qingdao. We propose an adaptation of current recommendations for practice. Lopinavir / ritonavir treatment. (lopinavirs / ritonsavir) treatment. Treatment for liver cancer.

There is no effective and approved vaccine or treatment for covid-19. There is sufficient evidence to recommend stringent hand hygiene and use of face masks. There are no direct scientific evidence regarding wearing protective masks in public spaces for asymptomatic people. The best approach is to develop a broad portfolio of vaccines in a coordinated manner. There are reports of significant shortages of medicstaff, a lack of clinics that can handle and treat infected patients, and high demands  for face masks for protection. There are often no instructions or playbook on how to best proceed in chaotic environments where cause and effect is unclear. stabilizing the system is chlenging. Coronaviruses belong to a family of viruses mainly found in anims but with the recent outbreak , they have transmitted to humans. Study: 37 % of participants admitted a  mask without the apparent signs and symptoms of the infection and more than 75 % felt the need to use sanitizers and gloves. , and, indeed, those who are giving babies formula milk, should \"practice respiratory hygiene during feeding,\" says the WHO.
