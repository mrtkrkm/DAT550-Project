       "' Covid-19 is spreading rapidly through europe and north america. We rely on quarantine, isolation, and infection-control measures to prevent disease spread and on supportive care for those who become ill. To date, there are no vaccines or treatments capable of preventing or treating hcov infections. Human influenza viruses continue to pose important threats to human heth in the modern sociy. As of february 3, 2020, there are more than 20,000 patients diagnosed with 2019-ncov infection in china one with more than 400 deaths. The fate of covid-19 remains unclear. Understanding the likely age and seasonprofiles of infection risks will be criticto inform effective surveillance and control strategies. 7 outbreaks of covid-19 are now being reported across the globe, and l physicians need to be prepared for cases in their communities. The risk of widespread nationcommunity transmission of the infection in the european union is considered high. Nearly 170,000 people have been diagnosed with the disease in the world. Covid-19 is a new coronaviruses. It is transmitted through the respiratory tract and is highly infectious for the heth of the people. It was swiftly included among the class b infectious diseases stipulated in the law of the. people’s republic of china on the prevention and control of infectious diseases. World endoscopy organization has recently released a recommendation on infection prevention and control in digestive endoscopies based on experiences from china. Early and transparent dissemination of research findings may lead to more expedited prevention and treatment efforts. We will give full play to tcm and folk medicines of hnic minorities in disease prevention and Control.'"
